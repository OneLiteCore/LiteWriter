This is a guide about how to recover your data. Either you think your data is lost or are transforming data between devices, this guide should help.

## Restore your data from recycle bin

If you delete your chapters or folders within the app, then this should be the best way to get your data back.

The deleted data will not be deleted immediately but moved into the recycle bin of the app. The files in the recycle bin will be kept 30 days before they are deleted automaticly.

Check this video to see how to use the recycle bin:

## Restore your data from snapshots

If you delete your chapters outside the app, say you have set a storage folder as the app's home folder but you use a file manager app to delete some chapters in the folder, in this case you can use the snapshot feature of the app.

Everytime the app saves your chapter, it creates a snapshot of it. By default every file will keep at most 30 snapshots, the oldest snapshots will be deleted automaticly when there is a new snapshot created.

## Restore data from the app internal backup or the local storage backup

This is usually the major way to restore your data if you accidently uninstall the app but still want to get your data back.

The recycle bin, the snapshots and the app internal backup will be cleared when uninstalling app, to ensure the data survive a uninstalling you need to setup a local storage backup.

## Restore data from a cloud backup server

The Recycle Bin and Snapshots features are both useful tool to retrieve your chapters if you still have access to the phone you used to writing those chapters. But if you wish to get your data back on your second phone, then you should use the Backup/Restore feature.

Be aware that this only works if you followed the guide of the app to set up a cloud backup server before, if you did, then this should be easy.
