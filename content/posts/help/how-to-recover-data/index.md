This guide will help you recover your data, whether it's been accidentally deleted or you're transferring data between devices.

## Restore Your Data from the Recycle Bin

If you delete chapters or folders within the app, they aren't immediately removed but moved to the app's recycle bin, allowing you to undo the deletion if needed.

Files in the recycle bin are kept for 30 days before being automatically deleted, so storage space won't be an issue.

Watch this video to learn how to use the recycle bin:

## Restore Your Data from Snapshots

If you accidentally delete chapters outside the app, such as using a file manager to delete files in the app home folder, you can recover them using the snapshot feature.

Each time the app saves your chapter, it creates a snapshot. By default, up to 30 snapshots are kept per file, with the oldest being replaced as new ones are created.

## Restore Data from the App Internal Backup

The app automatically backs up all data within its home folder into a ZIP file, stored in an internal folder. This internal backup is enabled by default and operates automatically.

## Restore Data from Local Storage Backup

If you accidentally uninstall the app but need to recover your data, the local storage backup is your best option.

The mechanisms mentioned above store data internally, so they're deleted if the app is uninstalled. To ensure backup data remains intact after uninstallation, set a folder on your device as the local storage backup folder. The app will then copy the backup ZIP file to this folder whenever it creates a new internal backup.

## Restore Data from a Cloud Backup Server

The local storage backup only works on a single device. If you lose your phone or want to transfer chapters to another device, use a cloud backup server.

Note: The cloud backup feature only works if you set it up in advance. If you did, restoring your data will be easy.

## Android OS Auto Backup

We don't recommend relying on Android OS auto backup, but for users who haven't set up a cloud backup server and have lost their phone, it might be a last resort.

If you logged into your Google Account and enabled auto backup in Google settings, Android OS automatically uploads the app internal backup ZIP files to a hidden space on your Google Drive every 24 hours.

However, this method is unreliable, so don't depend on it if your data is important to you.

Here's a demo on how to check if Android OS auto backup works:

You don't need to follow every step in this video. Just install the app on your new phone, if it works, you'll see a dialog with a list of backup files when you first open the app.

## Summary

We provide multiple tools to help keep your data safe and intact. However, if you neglect the importance of backing up, there's no guarantee you'll be able to recover everything if something goes wrong.
