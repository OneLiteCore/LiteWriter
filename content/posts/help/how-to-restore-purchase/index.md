If you've switched to a new device or reinstalled the app, this guide will help you restore your purchase of the Pro edition.

Currently, the Pro edition is sold as a Google Play in-app product, meaning Google Play services hold the purchase record.

# Ensure Access to International Networks

Google Play services may not be available in all regions due to local policies. If you're in such a region, you may need to use a workaround to access the service.

# Check Your Google Account

Make sure you're logged in with the same Google account used to make the purchase:

1. **Go to Google Play Store** -> **Click your account icon** -> **Payments & subscriptions.**  
2. Verify that there is a subscription or purchase history for the Pro edition of the app.

Once confirmed, go to the upgrade page in the app and tap on "Restore purchase" at the bottom. If everything is in order, this should restore your purchase.

# If Things Go Wrong

As Murphy's Law states, "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong."

If the app still can't restore your purchase, it could be a network or cache issue with Google Play services. Here's what to do:

1. Initiate a new purchase using the same subscription plan or product you've previously bought.

   **Note:** **You do not have to pay again.** Google Play does not allow duplicate purchases, so you should see an error indicating a duplicate. This action forces Google Play services to refresh its cache, which may resolve the issue.

# Missing SKUs?

SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) refers to a subscription plan or product. If some SKUs that you need are missing, do the following:

1. Go to **Settings** -> **Other settings** -> **Test lab** -> **Show all SKUs** and ensure this option is enabled.
   
This will reveal all SKUs, including those that may be disabled due to marketing strategies.

# Cancel a Subscription or Request a Refund

To cancel a subscription or request a refund:

1. Go to **Google Play Store** -> **Click your account icon** -> **Payments & subscriptions** and manage your purchase there.
