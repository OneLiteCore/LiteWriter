This article will help you restore your puchase, if you switch to a new device or have the app reinstalled, this should be helpful to you.

Currently we sell the Pro edition of the app as a Google Play In-app product, in this case Google Play service holds the purchase record of your purchase, not us.

# Make sure you have access to internaltional networks

Google Play service is not available all over the world, in some regions it is banned due to local policies. If you are living in such a region, you may need to find a way to deal with it.

# Check your Google account first

Please make sure that you've logged in and selected the same Google account which you used to make the purchase, both in your system's Google settings and Google Play Store.

Go to Google Play Store -> Click your account icon -> Payments & subscriptions, check if there is a subscription or purchase history of the app Pro edition. Make sure that you do have purchased before.

Then go to the upgrade page and hit the "Restore purchase" text on the bottom of the page, if nothing goes wrong your purchase would have been restored at this moment.

# If things goes wrong

As Murphy's Law says, "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong".

Sometimes even you have everything checked but the app still can't restore your purchase. This could be a network issue or a Goolge Play service cache issue. Luckily there is still one way to deal with this situation.

Google Play service does not allow a duplicate purchase, so if you do sure that you have purchased before, launch a new purchase flow with the same subscription plan or product you've purchased.

BE AWARE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY ONCE AGAIN.

As we said, Google Play service does not allow a duplicate purchase, so by doing so you would get an error code indicates that it is duplicated. This will force Google Play service to refresh its cache, therefore it might have the issue fixed.

# Missing SKUs?

SKU means a purchase plan, like a subscription plan or a product.

If some SKUs that you are looking for are missing, go to Settings -> Other settings -> Test lab -> Show all SKUs and make sure the option is enabled.

Due to some marketing strategies we might have disabled some SKUs like Semi-Annually subscription or Annually subscription. But with the option you could force enable all SKUs that the app ever supported.

# Cancel a subscription or refund a purchase?

Go to Google Play Store -> Click your account icon -> Payments & subscriptions and manage your purchase there.
