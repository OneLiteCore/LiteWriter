Pro questions require Pro solutions, and if a solution is useful then it certainly has value within, thus it should also have a price.

## Get a time-limited Pro Edition for FREE

We fully understand that there are users, like students who have passion to write but not that much ability to support us, or just simplify doesn't want to pay, so we added the Reward Points System.

Every day the first time you open the app you will be rewarded with some points which can be used to redeem a time-limited Pro Edition of the app. If you use the app a lot, you don't need to worry about things like shortage of the points. If you don't use the app a lot, then maybe you don't really need any Pro features since the app is barely useful to you.

Besides the Reward Points we also plan to add something like free trials so that you can determine if the app is useful to you without any costs, you will see this in future versions soon.

## Make this app completely FREE?

Sorry, we just can't.

Believe it or not, we developers are also living men who need to eat. We quit our jobs to work on this project, if we can't make any money from it to feed us, we are dead people, and so do the project. Dead people won't fix old issues and develop new features for a dead project, very simple, isn't it?

This is how things work in this world, you would understand if you are reasonable enough.
