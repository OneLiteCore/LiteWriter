## Make this app completely free?

Sorry, we just can't.

Pro questions require Pro solutions, and if a solution is useful then it certainly has value within, thus it should also have a price.

And believe it or not, we developers are also living men who need to eat. We quit our jobs to work on this project, if we can't make any money from it to feed us, we are dead people, and so do the project. Dead people won't fix old issues and develop new features for a dead project, very simple, isn't it?

## What do "books" mean in the app?

Technically they are just directly subdirectories under the app's home folder. And if there are files named "cover.jpg" and "intro.txt" (These names can be changed in settigns) under the book folder, it will be displayed on some pages like the main page and the book detail page.

## Why are the imported books merged into one folder?

The "import directory" feature, as its name, will import a directory into the app's home folder.

What is misleading is that when you select a directory with the system chooser it will also list its items, which might make you think that "The app should import what I can see into the app". But please remember that, the "Import directory" means "importing a directory into the app", not "Ignore the selected directory itself but import items within it".

If you want to import multiple directories as multiple books, you need to import multiple times.

If you really want to import seperated directories as seperated books in the app, just import their a directory and then move all the sub-directories out of the imported directory to the app's home folder by using the "File" tab on the app main page.
