## How to recover data

Please refer to this post:

## What do "books" mean in the app?

Technically they are just directly subdirectories under the app's home folder. And if there are files named "cover.jpg" and "intro.txt" (These names can be changed in settigns) under the book folder, it will be displayed on some pages like the main page and the book detail page.

## Why are the imported books merged into one folder?

The "import folder" feature, as its name, will import a folder into the app's home folder.

What is misleading is that when you select a folder with the system chooser it will also list its items, which might make you think that "The app should import what I can see into the app". But please remember that, the "Import folder" means "importing a single folder into the app", not "Ignore the selected folder itself but import items within it".

If you want to import multiple directories as multiple books, you need to import multiple times.

If you really want to import seperated directories as seperated books in the app, just import their a folder and then move all the sub-directories out of the imported folder to the app's home folder by using the "File" tab on the app main page.
